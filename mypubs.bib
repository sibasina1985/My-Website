abstract = {Measures of gait center of pressure (COP) can be recorded using simple available technologies in clinical settings and thus can be used to characterize gait quality in older adults and its relationship to falls. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the association between measures of gait COP and aging and falls. A comprehensive search of electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL (EBSCO), Ageline (EBSCO) and Scopus was performed. The initial search yielded 2809 papers. After removing duplicates and applying study inclusion/exclusion criteria, 34 papers were included in the review. Gait COP has been examined during three tasks: normal walking, gait initiation, and obstacle negotiation. The majority of studies examined mean COP position and velocity as outcome measures. Overall, gait in older adults was characterized by more medial COP trajectory in normal walking and lower average anterior-posterior and medio-lateral COP displacements and velocity in both gait initiation and obstacle crossing. Moreover, findings suggest that Tai chi training can enhance older adults' balance control during gait initiation as demonstrated by greater COP backward, medial and forward shift in all three phases of gait initiation. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to inadequacy of evidence as well as methodological limitations of the studies such as small sample size, limited numbers of ‘fallers', lack of a control group, and lack of interpretation of COP outcomes with respect to fall risk. COP measures can be adopted to assess fall-related gait changes in older adults but more complex measures of COP that reveal the dynamic nature of COP behavior in step-to-step variations are needed to adequately characterize gait changes in older adults.},

abstract = {Objectives: To develop a prognostic model to predict the probability of a short-term fall (within the next 7 to 30 days) in older adults with dementia. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting and Participants: Fifty-one individuals with dementia at high risk of falls from a specialized dementia inpatient unit. Methods: Clinical and demographic measures were collected and a vision-based markerless motion capture was used to record the natural gait of participants over a 2-week baseline. Falls were tracked throughout the length of stay. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to build a prognostic model to determine fall-free survival probabilities at 7 days and at 30 days. The model's discriminative ability was also internally validated. Results: Fall history and gait stability (estimated margin of stability) were statistically significant predictors of time to fall and included in the final prognostic model. The model's predicted survival probabilities were close to observed values at both 7 and 30 days. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.67 at 30 days and the model had a discrimination performance (the Harrel concordance index) of 0.71. Conclusions and Implications: Our short-term falls risk model had fair to good predictive and discrimination ability. Gait stability and recent fall history predicted an imminent fall in our population. This provides some preliminary evidence that the degree of gait instability may be measureable in natural everyday gait to allow dynamic falls risk monitoring. External validation of the model using a separate data set is needed to evaluate model's predictive performance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gait impairments contribute to falls in people with dementia. In this study, we used a vision-based system to record episodes of walking over a 2-week period as participants moved naturally around their environment, and from these calculated spatiotemporal, stability, symmetry, and acceleration gait features. The aim of this study was to determine whether features of gait extracted from a vision-based system are associated with falls, and which of these features are most strongly associated with falling. METHODS: Fifty-two people with dementia admitted to a specialized dementia unit participated in this study. Thirty different features describing baseline gait were extracted from Kinect recordings of natural gait over a 2-week period. Baseline clinical and demographic measures were collected, and falls were tracked throughout the participants' admission. RESULTS: A total of 1,744 gait episodes were recorded (mean 33.5 ± 23.0 per participant) over a 2-week baseline period. There were a total of 78 falls during the study period (range 0-10). In single variable analyses, the estimated lateral margin of stability, step width, and step time variability were significantly associated with the number of falls during admission. In a multivariate model controlling for clinical and demographic variables, the estimated lateral margin of stability (p = .01) was remained associated with number of falls. CONCLUSIONS: Information about gait can be extracted from vision-based recordings of natural walking. In particular, the lateral margin of stability, a measure of lateral gait stability, is an important marker of short-term falls risk.},

abstract = {Background: Parkinsonism is common in people with dementia, and is associated with neurodegenerative and vascular changes in the brain, or with exposure to antipsychotic or other dopamine antagonist medications. The detection of parkinsonian changes to gait may provide an opportunity to intervene and address reversible causes. In this study, we investigate the use of a vision-based system as an unobtrusive means to assess severity of parkinsonism in gait. Methods: Videos of walking bouts of natural gait were collected in a specialized dementia unit using a Microsoft Kinect sensor and onboard color camera, and were processed to extract sixteen 3D and eight 2D gait features. Univariate regression to gait quality, as rated on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), was used to identify gait features significantly correlated to these clinical scores for inclusion in multivariate models. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression was subsequently performed and the relative contribution of each gait feature for regression to UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait scores was assessed. Results: Four hundred one walking bouts from 14 older adults with dementia were included in the analysis. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models incorporating selected 2D or 3D gait features attained similar accuracies: the UPDRS-gait regression models achieved accuracies of 61.4 and 62.1{\%} for 2D and 3D features, respectively. Similarly, the SAS-gait models achieved accuracies of 47.4 and 48.5{\%} with 2D or 3D gait features, respectively. Conclusions: Gait features extracted from both 2D and 3D videos are correlated to UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait scores of parkinsonism severity in gait. Vision-based systems have the potential to be used as tools for longitudinal monitoring of parkinsonism in residential settings.},

Gait impairment contributes to increased fall risk, and gait changes are common in people with dementia, although the reliable assessment of gait is challenging in this population. This study aimed to develop an automated approach to performing gait assessments based on gait data that is collected frequently and unobtrusively, and analysed using computer vision methods. Recent developments in computer vision have led to the availability of open source human pose estimation algorithms, which automatically estimate the joint locations of a person in an image. In this study, a pre-existing pose estimation model was applied to 1066 walking videos collected of 31 older adults with dementia as they walked naturally in a corridor on a specialized dementia unit over a two week period. Using the tracked pose information, gait features were extracted from video recordings of gait bouts and their association with clinical mobility assessment scores and future falls data was examined. A significant association was found between extracted gait features and a clinical mobility assessment and the number of future falls, providing concurrent and predictive validation of this approach.},

The present study investigates if rigid-rocker shoes influence diabetic gait stability. Methods: Fourteen non-neuropathic and nine neuropathic diabetics, plus eleven healthy young-adults were recruited. Full-body kinematic data was captured during walking tasks. Experimental conditions included barefoot and three rocker-shoe designs according to the rocker angle, apex angle and apex position (R10: 10°, 80°, 60{\%}; R15: 15°, 95°, 52{\%}; R20: 20°, 95°, 60{\%}). Sagittal and frontal stability margin, plus fear of fall were main outcome measures. Findings. Sagittal stability margin was not affected by health, however, was increased with R10 and R15 in non-neuropathic diabetics and healthy individuals (R2 = 0.16). Variability of sagittal stability margin was not altered in neuropathic diabetics, but was increased with R15 and R20 in healthy participants, with R15 in non-neuropathic diabetics (R2 = 0.12). Frontal stability margin (R2 = 0.46) and its variability (R2 = 0.39) were significantly increased in neuropathic and non-neuropathic diabetics compared to healthy individuals. Frontal stability margin was significantly higher with R15 in neuropathic diabetics, with R20 in non-neuropathic and healthy participants. Sagittal and frontal stability margin were strongly correlated with fear of fall in neuropathic diabetics. Interpretations. R15 and R20 might challenge gait stability of diabetics cause them restrict centre of mass motion thereby imposing a tighter control over walking. However, neuropathic diabetics generally walk very cautious due to their neuropathy and higher fear of fall. Frontal stability margin, highly affected by health and experimental condition, is a more sensitive indicator of gait stability.},

abstract = {Background: Return to sport (RTS) criteria are widely being used to identify anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed (ACLR) athletes ready to return to sportive activity and reduce risk of ACL re-injury. However, studies show a high rate of ACL re-injury in athletes who passed RTS criteria. This indicates that the current RTS criteria might not be sufficient to determine return to sport time in ACLR athletes. Previous studies have reported a close association between altered lower limb kinematics and ACL re-injury. However, it is not clear how lower extremity kinematics differs between ACLR athletes who passed the RTS-criteria and who failed. This study compared lower extremity kinematics in a jump-landing task between ACLR athletes who passed the RTS criteria (Limb symmetry in hop tests, quadriceps strength and questionnaires) to those who failed and to the healthy individuals. Methods: Participants were 27 male football players with unilateral ACLR including 14 who passed-RTS criteria and 13 failed, and 15 healthy football players. A 3D motion capture system recorded participants' lower extremity motion while performing 10 trials of a bilateral jump-landing task. Hip, knee and ankle angular motion were examined at initial contact. Two-way mixed analysis of variances (2 limbs × 3 groups) and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were performed to compare the joint angles between the limbs and groups. Results: Lower hip abduction angle was found in the failed (involved limb 4.1 ° ± 4.2) and passed RTS (involved limb 6.8° ± 3.3) groups compared to the healthy group (non-dominant limb 10.7° ± 3.7). Ankle inversion in the failed RTS (0.4° ± 4.9) group was significantly lower than both passed RTS (4.8° ± 4.8, p = 0.05) and healthy (8.2° ± 8.1, p {\textless} 0.001) groups. There were no significant differences between the groups in knee kinematics. Conclusions: Our findings indicate reduced hip abduction during initial contact phase of landing in athletes returned to sport. Reduced hip abduction during the complex multiplanar movement of jump-landing is a risk factor for ACL re-injury. Current RTS criteria may not be sufficient to identify ACLR athletes at high risk of re-injury. The kinematic analysis in conjunction with current RTS criteria can provide additional insight into the return to sport decision making.},

abstract = {The development of methods that can identify athlete-specific optimum sports techniques—arguably the holy grail of sports biomechanics—is one of the greatest challenges for researchers in the field. This ‘perspectives article' critically examines, from a dynamical systems theoretical standpoint, the claim that athlete-specific optimum sports techniques can be identified through biomechanical optimisation modelling. To identify athlete-specific optimum sports techniques, dynamical systems theory suggests that a representative set of organismic constraints, along with their non-linear characteristics, needs to be identified and incorporated into the mathematical model of the athlete. However, whether the athlete will be able to adopt, and reliably reproduce, his/her predicted optimum technique will largely be dependent on his/her intrinsic dynamics. If the attractor valley corresponding to the existing technique is deep, or if the attractor valleys corresponding to the existing technique and the predicted optimum technique are in different topographical regions of the dynamic landscape, technical modifications may be challenging or impossible to reliably implement even after extended practice. The attractor layout defining the intrinsic dynamics of the athlete, therefore, needs to be determined to establish the likelihood of the predicted optimum technique being reliably attainable by the athlete. Given the limited set of organismic constraints typically used in mathematical models of athletes, combined with the methodological challenges associated with mapping the attractor layout of an athlete, it seems unlikely that athlete-specific optimum sports techniques will be identifiable through biomechanical optimisation modelling for the majority of sports skills in the near future.},

To this aim, the effect of increasing number of initial neighboring points on the LyE value was investigated and compared to values obtained by filtering the time series. Both simulated (Lorenz and passive dynamic walker) and experimental (human walking) time series were used to calculate the LyE. The number of initial neighbors used to calculate LyE for all time series was 1 (the original Rosenstein's method), 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 data points. The results demonstrated that the LyE graph reached a plateau at the 15-point neighboring condition implying that the LyE values calculated using at least 15 neighboring points were consistent. The proposed method could be used to calculate more consistent LyE values in experimental time series acquired from biological systems where noise is omnipresent.},

abstract = {This paper evaluates the effectiveness of, and highlights issues with, conventional paradigms in applied sports biomechanics research and comments on their capacity to optimise techniques of individual athletes. In empirical studies, group-based analyses often mask variability between athletes and only permit probabilistic ‘in general' or ‘on average' statements that may not be applicable to specific athletes. In individual-based analyses, performance parameters typically exhibit a small range and a flat response over iterative performance trials, making establishing associations between performance parameters and the performance criterion problematic. In theoretical studies, computer simulation modelling putatively enables athlete-specific optimum techniques to be identified, but given each athlete's unique intrinsic dynamics, it is far from certain that these optimum techniques will be attainable, particularly under the often intense psychological pressures of competition, irrespective of the volume of practice undertaken. Sports biomechanists and coaching practitioners are advised to be more circumspect with regard to interpreting the results of applied sports biomechanics research and have greater awareness of their assumptions and limitations, as inappropriate interpretation of results may have adverse consequences for performance and injury.},

Order error is the change of CRP order between two degrees of freedom (e.g., body segments) when using the conventional method of constructing phase-plane portraits (i.e., velocity over position). Both sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal simulated signals as well as signals from human movement kinematics were used to investigate order error and the performance of the two alternative methods. Both methods have been shown to lead to correct results for simulated sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal signals. For human movement data, however, the Hilbert transform is superior for calculating CRP.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V. The largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) is an accepted method to quantify gait stability in young and old adults. However, a range of LyE values has been reported in the literature for healthy young and elderly adults in normal walking. Therefore, it has been impractical to use the LyE as a clinical measure of gait stability. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize different methodological approaches of quantifying LyE, as well as to classify LyE values of different body segments and joints in young and elderly individuals during normal walking. The Pubmed, Ovid Medline, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases were searched using keywords related to gait, stability, variability, and LyE. Only English language articles using the Lyapunov exponent to quantify the stability of healthy normal young and old subjects walking on a level surface were considered. 102 papers were included for full-text review and data extraction. Data associated with the walking surface, data recording method, sampling rate, walking speed, body segments and joints, number of strides/steps, variable type, filtering, time-normalizing, state space dimension, time delay, LyE algorithm, and the LyE values were extracted. The disparity in implementation and calculation of the LyE was from, (i) experiment design, (ii) data pre-processing, and (iii) LyE calculation method. For practical implementation of LyE as a measure of gait stability in clinical settings, a standard and universally accepted approach of calculating LyE is required. Therefore, future studies should look for a standard and generalized procedure to apply and calculate LyE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd This study aimed to determine the effect of added noise, filtering and time series length on the largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) value calculated for time series obtained from a passive dynamic walker. The simplest passive dynamic walker model comprising of two massless legs connected by a frictionless hinge joint at the hip was adopted to generate walking time series. The generated time series was used to construct a state space with the embedding dimension of 3 and time delay of 100 samples. The LyE was calculated as the exponential rate of divergence of neighboring trajectories of the state space using Rosenstein's algorithm. To determine the effect of noise on LyE values, seven levels of Gaussian white noise (SNR = 55–25 dB with 5 dB steps) were added to the time series. In addition, the filtering was performed using a range of cutoff frequencies from 3 Hz to 19 Hz with 2 Hz steps. The LyE was calculated for both noise-free and noisy time series with different lengths of 6, 50, 100 and 150 strides. Results demonstrated a high percent error in the presence of noise for LyE. Therefore, these observations suggest that Rosenstein's algorithm might not perform well in the presence of added experimental noise. Furthermore, findings indicated that at least 50 walking strides are required to calculate LyE to account for the effect of noise. Finally, observations support that a conservative filtering of the time series with a high cutoff frequency might be more appropriate prior to calculating LyE.},

Anterior cruciate ligament injury is a debilitating pathology which may alter lower limb coordination pattern in both intact and affected lower extremities during activities of daily living. Emerging evidence supports the notion that kinematic variables may not be a good indicator to differentiate patients with anterior cruciate ligament deficiency during step descent task. The aim of the present study was to examine alterations in kinematics as well as coordination patterns and coordination variability of both limbs of these patients during a single step descent task. Continuous relative phase technique was used to measure coordination pattern and coordination variability between a group of anterior cruciate ligament deficient (n = 23) and a healthy control group (n = 23). A third order polynomial Curve fitting was utilized to provide a curve that best fitted to the data points of coordination pattern and coordination variability of the healthy control group. This was considered as a reference to compare to that of patient group using nonlinear regression analysis. The results of the present study demonstrated an altered coordination pattern of the supporting shank-thigh and the stepping foot-shank couplings in anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects. It was further noticed that there was an increased coordination variability in foot-shank and shankthigh couplings of both supporting and stepping legs. There was no significant difference in the hip, knee and ankle joints kinematics in either side of these patients. Anterior cruciate ligament deficient individuals showed altered strategies in both intact and affected legs, with increased coordination variability. Kinematic data did not indicate any significant difference between the two groups. It could be concluded that more sophisticated dynamic approach such as continuous relative phase would uncover discrepancies between the healthy and anterior cruciate ligament deficient individuals.},

The aim of this study was to investigate effects of speed and plane of motion on stability during locomotion in skilled football players. Ten male national-level football players participated in this study to run forward, backward and in lateral directions on a treadmill at 80{\%}, 100{\%} and 120{\%} of their preferred running speeds. The coordinate data of passive reflective markers attached to body segments were recorded using motion capture systems. Time series data obtained from the ankle marker were used for further analyses. The largest finite-time Lyapunov exponent and maximum Floquet multiplier were adopted to quantify local and orbital dynamic stabilities, respectively. Results showed that speed did not significantly change local and orbital dynamic stabilities in any of running patterns. However, both local and orbital dynamic stability were significantly higher in the secondary plane of progression. Data revealed that in running, unlike walking, stability in the direction perpendicular to the direction of running is significantly higher, implying that less active control is required in the secondary plane of progression. The results of this study could be useful in sports training and rehabilitation programmes where development of fundamental exercise programmes that challenge both speed and the ability to maintain stability might produce a tangible enhancement of athletic skill level.},

abstract = {Abstract: Agility is an essential part of many athletic activities. Currently, agility drill duration is the sole criterion used for evaluation of agility performance. The relationship between drill duration and factors such as acceleration, deceleration and change of direction, however, has not been fully explored. This paper provides a mathematical description of the relationship between velocity and radius of curvatures in an agility drill through implementation of a power law (PL). Two groups of skilled and unskilled participants performed a cyclic forward/backward shuttle agility test. Kinematic data was recorded using motion capture system at a sampling rate of 200 Hz. The logarithmic relationship between tangential velocity and radius of curvature of participant trajectories in both groups was established using the PL. The slope of the regression line was found to be 0.26 and 0.36, for the skilled and unskilled groups, respectively. The magnitudes of regression line slope for both groups were approximately 0.3 which is close to the expected 1/3 value. Results are an indication of how the PL could be implemented in an agility drill thus opening the way for establishment of a more representative measure of agility performance instead of drill duration.},

abstract = {Research has indicated that human walking is more unstable in the secondary, rather than primary plane of progression. However, the mechanisms of controlling dynamic stability in different planes of progression during running remain unknown. The aim of this study was to compare variability (standard deviation and coefficient of variation) and dynamic stability (sample entropy and local divergence exponent) in anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions in forward and lateral running patterns. For this purpose, fifteen healthy, male participants ran in a forward and lateral direction on a treadmill at their preferred running speeds. Coordinate data of passive reflective markers attached to body segments were recorded using a motion capture system. Results indicated that: (1) there is lower dynamic stability in the primary plane of progression during both forward and lateral running suggesting that, unlike walking, greater control might be required to regulate dynamic stability in the primary plane of progression during running, (2) as in walking, the control of stability in anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions of running is dependent on the direction of progression, and (3), quantifying magnitude of variability might not be sufficient to understand control mechanisms in human movement and directly measuring dynamic stability could be an appropriate alternative.},

The aims of this study were to compare coordination and coordination variability in backward and forward running and to investigate the effects of speed on coordination variability in both backward and forward running. Fifteen healthy male participants took part in this study to run forwards and backwards on a treadmill at 80{\%}, 100{\%} and 120{\%} of their preferred running speeds. The coordinate data of passive reflective markers attached to body segments were recorded using motion capture systems. Coordination of shank-foot and thigh-shank couplings in sagittal plane was quantified using the continuous relative phase method. Coordination variability was calculated as the standard deviation of a coordination pattern over 50 strides. Cross-correlation coefficients and associated phase shifts were determined to quantify similarity in coordination patterns between forward and backward running. Our results demonstrated that the coordination pattern in a gait cycle of backward running was in reverse to that of forward running at all speeds implying that the same neural circuitry is responsible for regulating both forward and backward running gaits. In addition, results demonstrated that there was an average of approximately 11{\%} phase shift between the coordination patterns of backward and forward running which indicates that a single underlying mechanism might be responsible for generating motor patterns in both forward and backward running. Finally, backward running had significantly higher magnitude of coordination variability compared to forward running, signifying that more degrees of freedom were involved in backward running. Speed however, did not affect coordination variability in either task.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V. Identification of control strategies during agility performance is significant in understanding movement behavior. This study aimed at providing a fundamental mathematical model for describing the motion of participants during an agility drill and to determine whether skill level constrained model components. Motion patterns of two groups of skilled and unskilled participants (n= 8 in each) during performance of a forward/backward agility drill modeled as limit-cycles. Participant movements were recorded by motion capture of a reflective marker attached to the sacrum of each individual. Graphical and regression analyses of movement kinematics in Hooke's plane, phase plane and velocity profile were performed to determine components of the models. Results showed that the models of both skilled and unskilled groups had terms from Duffing stiffness as well as Van der Pol damping oscillators. Data also indicated that the proposed models captured on average 97{\%} of the variance for both skilled and unskilled groups. Findings from this study revealed the movement patterning associated with skilled and unskilled performance in a typical forward/backward agility drill which might be helpful for trainers and physiotherapists in enhancing agility.},

This study implemented linear and nonlinear methods of measuring variability to determine differences in stability of two groups of skilled (n = 10) and unskilled (n = 10) participants performing 3m forward/backward shuttle agility drill. We also determined whether stability measures differed between the forward and backward segments of the drill. Finally, we sought to investigate whether local dynamic stability, measured using largest finite-time Lyapunov exponents, changed from distal to proximal lower extremity segments. Three-dimensional coordinates of five lower extremity markers data were recorded. Results revealed that the Lyapunov exponents were lower (P  {\textless}  0.05) for skilled participants at all joint markers indicative of higher levels of local dynamic stability. Additionally, stability of motion did not differ between forward and backward segments of the drill (P  {\textgreater}  0.05), signifying that almost the same control strategy was used in forward and backward directions by all participants, regardless of skill level. Furthermore, local dynamic stability increased from distal to proximal joints (P  {\textless}  0.05) indicating that stability of proximal segments are prioritized by the neuromuscular control system. Finally, skilled participants displayed greater foot placement standard deviation values (P  {\textless}  0.05), indicative of adaptation to task constraints. The results of this study provide new methods for sport scientists, coaches to characterize stability in agility drill performance.},

Abstract: A number of studies have investigated effects of speed on local dynamic stability of walking, although this relationship has been rarely investigated under changing task constraints, such as during forward and backward running. To rectify this gap in the literature, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of running speed on local dynamic stability of forward and backward running on a treadmill. Fifteen healthy male participants took part in this study. Participants ran in forward and backward directions at speeds of 80{\%}, 100{\%} and 120{\%} of their preferred running speed. The three-dimensional motion of a C7 marker was recorded using a motion capture system. Local dynamic stability of the marker was quantified using short- and long-term largest finite-time Lyapunov exponents (LyE). Results showed that short-term largest finite-time LyE values increased with participant speed meaning that local dynamic stability decreased with increasing speed. Long-term largest finite-time LyEs, however, remained unaffected as speed increased. Results of this study indicated that, as in walking, slow running is more stable than fast running. These findings improve understanding of how stability is regulated when constraints on the speed of movements is altered. Implications for the design of rehabilitation or sport practice programmes suggest how task constraints could be manipulated to facilitate adaptations in locomotion stability during athletic training.},

Through a linear elastic theory and using Bridgman method, necking phenomenon is considered for brain tissue in tension test. Results show that gray and white matters have different mechanical properties and differences between true and nominal values (the effect of cross section changes of the samples during the test) are not negligible. Besides, it is shown that for certain strains, linear elastic theory is acceptable for brain tissue modeling.
