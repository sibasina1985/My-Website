I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute-UHN, Toronto, Canada. My research is on the neuromechanics of human locomotion. In other words, I try to understand priniciples underlying control of walking balance and to use these principles to design rehabilitation protocols for affected groups such as older adults at risk of falls. My research results have been published in premier academic journals in the field of biomechanics, motor control, and gerontology.
