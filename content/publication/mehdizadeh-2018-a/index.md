abstract: Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V. The largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) is an accepted
  method to quantify gait stability in young and old adults. However, a range of LyE
  values has been reported in the literature for healthy young and elderly adults
  in normal walking. Therefore, it has been impractical to use the LyE as a clinical
  measure of gait stability. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize
  different methodological approaches of quantifying LyE, as well as to classify LyE
  values of different body segments and joints in young and elderly individuals during
  normal walking. The Pubmed, Ovid Medline, Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases
  were searched using keywords related to gait, stability, variability, and LyE. Only
  English language articles using the Lyapunov exponent to quantify the stability
  of healthy normal young and old subjects walking on a level surface were considered.
  102 papers were included for full-text review and data extraction. Data associated
  with the walking surface, data recording method, sampling rate, walking speed, body
  segments and joints, number of strides/steps, variable type, filtering, time-normalizing,
  state space dimension, time delay, LyE algorithm, and the LyE values were extracted.
  The disparity in implementation and calculation of the LyE was from, (i) experiment
  design, (ii) data pre-processing, and (iii) LyE calculation method. For practical
  implementation of LyE as a measure of gait stability in clinical settings, a standard
  and universally accepted approach of calculating LyE is required. Therefore, future
  studies should look for a standard and generalized procedure to apply and calculate
  LyE.
