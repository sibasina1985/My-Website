  and source are credited. Anterior cruciate ligament injury is a debilitating pathology
  which may alter lower limb coordination pattern in both intact and affected lower
  extremities during activities of daily living. Emerging evidence supports the notion
  that kinematic variables may not be a good indicator to differentiate patients with
  anterior cruciate ligament deficiency during step descent task. The aim of the present
  study was to examine alterations in kinematics as well as coordination patterns
  and coordination variability of both limbs of these patients during a single step
  descent task. Continuous relative phase technique was used to measure coordination
  pattern and coordination variability between a group of anterior cruciate ligament
  deficient (n = 23) and a healthy control group (n = 23). A third order polynomial
  Curve fitting was utilized to provide a curve that best fitted to the data points
  of coordination pattern and coordination variability of the healthy control group.
  This was considered as a reference to compare to that of patient group using nonlinear
  regression analysis. The results of the present study demonstrated an altered coordination
  pattern of the supporting shank-thigh and the stepping foot-shank couplings in anterior
  cruciate ligament deficient subjects. It was further noticed that there was an increased
  coordination variability in foot-shank and shankthigh couplings of both supporting
  and stepping legs. There was no significant difference in the hip, knee and ankle
  joints kinematics in either side of these patients. Anterior cruciate ligament deficient
  individuals showed altered strategies in both intact and affected legs, with increased
  coordination variability. Kinematic data did not indicate any significant difference
  between the two groups. It could be concluded that more sophisticated dynamic approach
  such as continuous relative phase would uncover discrepancies between the healthy
  and anterior cruciate ligament deficient individuals.
