abstract: "Background: Parkinsonism is common in people with dementia, and is associated\
  \ with neurodegenerative and vascular changes in the brain, or with exposure to\
  \ antipsychotic or other dopamine antagonist medications. The detection of parkinsonian\
  \ changes to gait may provide an opportunity to intervene and address reversible\
  \ causes. In this study, we investigate the use of a vision-based system as an unobtrusive\
  \ means to assess severity of parkinsonism in gait. Methods: Videos of walking bouts\
  \ of natural gait were collected in a specialized dementia unit using a Microsoft\
  \ Kinect sensor and onboard color camera, and were processed to extract sixteen\
  \ 3D and eight 2D gait features. Univariate regression to gait quality, as rated\
  \ on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Simpson-Angus Scale\
  \ (SAS), was used to identify gait features significantly correlated to these clinical\
  \ scores for inclusion in multivariate models. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression\
  \ was subsequently performed and the relative contribution of each gait feature\
  \ for regression to UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait scores was assessed. Results: Four hundred\
  \ one walking bouts from 14 older adults with dementia were included in the analysis.\
  \ Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models incorporating selected 2D or 3D\
  \ gait features attained similar accuracies: the UPDRS-gait regression models achieved\
  \ accuracies of 61.4 and 62.1% for 2D and 3D features, respectively. Similarly,\
  \ the SAS-gait models achieved accuracies of 47.4 and 48.5% with 2D or 3D gait features,\
  \ respectively. Conclusions: Gait features extracted from both 2D and 3D videos\
  \ are correlated to UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait scores of parkinsonism severity in gait.\
  \ Vision-based systems have the potential to be used as tools for longitudinal monitoring\
  \ of parkinsonism in residential settings."
