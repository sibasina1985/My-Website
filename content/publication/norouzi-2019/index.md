abstract: "Background: Return to sport (RTS) criteria are widely being used to identify\
  \ anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed (ACLR) athletes ready to return to sportive\
  \ activity and reduce risk of ACL re-injury. However, studies show a high rate of\
  \ ACL re-injury in athletes who passed RTS criteria. This indicates that the current\
  \ RTS criteria might not be sufficient to determine return to sport time in ACLR\
  \ athletes. Previous studies have reported a close association between altered lower\
  \ limb kinematics and ACL re-injury. However, it is not clear how lower extremity\
  \ kinematics differs between ACLR athletes who passed the RTS-criteria and who failed.\
  \ This study compared lower extremity kinematics in a jump-landing task between\
  \ ACLR athletes who passed the RTS criteria (Limb symmetry in hop tests, quadriceps\
  \ strength and questionnaires) to those who failed and to the healthy individuals.\
  \ Methods: Participants were 27 male football players with unilateral ACLR including\
  \ 14 who passed-RTS criteria and 13 failed, and 15 healthy football players. A 3D\
  \ motion capture system recorded participants' lower extremity motion while performing\
  \ 10 trials of a bilateral jump-landing task. Hip, knee and ankle angular motion\
  \ were examined at initial contact. Two-way mixed analysis of variances (2 limbs\
  \ × 3 groups) and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were performed to compare the joint\
  \ angles between the limbs and groups. Results: Lower hip abduction angle was found\
  \ in the failed (involved limb 4.1 ° ± 4.2) and passed RTS (involved limb 6.8° ±\
  \ 3.3) groups compared to the healthy group (non-dominant limb 10.7° ± 3.7). Ankle\
  \ inversion in the failed RTS (0.4° ± 4.9) group was significantly lower than both\
  \ passed RTS (4.8° ± 4.8, p = 0.05) and healthy (8.2° ± 8.1, p textless 0.001) groups.\
  \ There were no significant differences between the groups in knee kinematics. Conclusions:\
  \ Our findings indicate reduced hip abduction during initial contact phase of landing\
  \ in athletes returned to sport. Reduced hip abduction during the complex multiplanar\
  \ movement of jump-landing is a risk factor for ACL re-injury. Current RTS criteria\
  \ may not be sufficient to identify ACLR athletes at high risk of re-injury. The\
  \ kinematic analysis in conjunction with current RTS criteria can provide additional\
  \ insight into the return to sport decision making."
