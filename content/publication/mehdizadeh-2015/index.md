abstract: Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. Identification of control strategies during agility
  performance is significant in understanding movement behavior. This study aimed
  at providing a fundamental mathematical model for describing the motion of participants
  during an agility drill and to determine whether skill level constrained model components.
  Motion patterns of two groups of skilled and unskilled participants (n= 8 in each)
  during performance of a forward/backward agility drill modeled as limit-cycles.
  Participant movements were recorded by motion capture of a reflective marker attached
  to the sacrum of each individual. Graphical and regression analyses of movement
  kinematics in Hooke's plane, phase plane and velocity profile were performed to
  determine components of the models. Results showed that the models of both skilled
  and unskilled groups had terms from Duffing stiffness as well as Van der Pol damping
  oscillators. Data also indicated that the proposed models captured on average 97%
  of the variance for both skilled and unskilled groups. Findings from this study
  revealed the movement patterning associated with skilled and unskilled performance
  in a typical forward/backward agility drill which might be helpful for trainers
  and physiotherapists in enhancing agility.
