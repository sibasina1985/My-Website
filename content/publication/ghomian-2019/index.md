abstract: 'Background: Rigid-rocker shoes may induce gait instability in diabetics,
  however, is not clearly investigated. The present study investigates if rigid-rocker
  shoes influence diabetic gait stability. Methods: Fourteen non-neuropathic and nine
  neuropathic diabetics, plus eleven healthy young-adults were recruited. Full-body
  kinematic data was captured during walking tasks. Experimental conditions included
  barefoot and three rocker-shoe designs according to the rocker angle, apex angle
  and apex position (R10: 10°, 80°, 60%; R15: 15°, 95°, 52%; R20: 20°, 95°, 60%).
  Sagittal and frontal stability margin, plus fear of fall were main outcome measures.
  Findings. Sagittal stability margin was not affected by health, however, was increased
  with R10 and R15 in non-neuropathic diabetics and healthy individuals (R2 = 0.16).
  Variability of sagittal stability margin was not altered in neuropathic diabetics,
  but was increased with R15 and R20 in healthy participants, with R15 in non-neuropathic
  diabetics (R2 = 0.12). Frontal stability margin (R2 = 0.46) and its variability
  (R2 = 0.39) were significantly increased in neuropathic and non-neuropathic diabetics
  compared to healthy individuals. Frontal stability margin was significantly higher
  with R15 in neuropathic diabetics, with R20 in non-neuropathic and healthy participants.
  Sagittal and frontal stability margin were strongly correlated with fear of fall
  in neuropathic diabetics. Interpretations. R15 and R20 might challenge gait stability
  of diabetics cause them restrict centre of mass motion thereby imposing a tighter
  control over walking. However, neuropathic diabetics generally walk very cautious
  due to their neuropathy and higher fear of fall. Frontal stability margin, highly
  affected by health and experimental condition, is a more sensitive indicator of
  gait stability.'
