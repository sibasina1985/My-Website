  This study implemented linear and nonlinear methods of measuring variability to
  determine differences in stability of two groups of skilled (n = 10) and unskilled
  (n = 10) participants performing 3m forward/backward shuttle agility drill. We also
  determined whether stability measures differed between the forward and backward
  segments of the drill. Finally, we sought to investigate whether local dynamic stability,
  measured using largest finite-time Lyapunov exponents, changed from distal to proximal
  lower extremity segments. Three-dimensional coordinates of five lower extremity
  markers data were recorded. Results revealed that the Lyapunov exponents were lower
  (P  textless  0.05) for skilled participants at all joint markers indicative of
  higher levels of local dynamic stability. Additionally, stability of motion did
  not differ between forward and backward segments of the drill (P  textgreater  0.05),
  signifying that almost the same control strategy was used in forward and backward
  directions by all participants, regardless of skill level. Furthermore, local dynamic
  stability increased from distal to proximal joints (P  textless  0.05) indicating
  that stability of proximal segments are prioritized by the neuromuscular control
  system. Finally, skilled participants displayed greater foot placement standard
  deviation values (P  textless  0.05), indicative of adaptation to task constraints.
  The results of this study provide new methods for sport scientists, coaches to characterize
  stability in agility drill performance.
