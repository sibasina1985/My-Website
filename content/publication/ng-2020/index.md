abstract: Fall risk is high for older adults with dementia. Gait impairment contributes
  to increased fall risk, and gait changes are common in people with dementia, although
  the reliable assessment of gait is challenging in this population. This study aimed
  to develop an automated approach to performing gait assessments based on gait data
  that is collected frequently and unobtrusively, and analysed using computer vision
  methods. Recent developments in computer vision have led to the availability of
  open source human pose estimation algorithms, which automatically estimate the joint
  locations of a person in an image. In this study, a pre-existing pose estimation
  model was applied to 1066 walking videos collected of 31 older adults with dementia
  as they walked naturally in a corridor on a specialized dementia unit over a two
  week period. Using the tracked pose information, gait features were extracted from
  video recordings of gait bouts and their association with clinical mobility assessment
  scores and future falls data was examined. A significant association was found between
  extracted gait features and a clinical mobility assessment and the number of future
  falls, providing concurrent and predictive validation of this approach.
