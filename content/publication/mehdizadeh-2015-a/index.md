abstract: Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V. The aims of this study were to compare coordination
  and coordination variability in backward and forward running and to investigate
  the effects of speed on coordination variability in both backward and forward running.
  Fifteen healthy male participants took part in this study to run forwards and backwards
  on a treadmill at 80%, 100% and 120% of their preferred running speeds. The coordinate
  data of passive reflective markers attached to body segments were recorded using
  motion capture systems. Coordination of shank-foot and thigh-shank couplings in
  sagittal plane was quantified using the continuous relative phase method. Coordination
  variability was calculated as the standard deviation of a coordination pattern over
  50 strides. Cross-correlation coefficients and associated phase shifts were determined
  to quantify similarity in coordination patterns between forward and backward running.
  Our results demonstrated that the coordination pattern in a gait cycle of backward
  running was in reverse to that of forward running at all speeds implying that the
  same neural circuitry is responsible for regulating both forward and backward running
  gaits. In addition, results demonstrated that there was an average of approximately
  11% phase shift between the coordination patterns of backward and forward running
  which indicates that a single underlying mechanism might be responsible for generating
  motor patterns in both forward and backward running. Finally, backward running had
  significantly higher magnitude of coordination variability compared to forward running,
  signifying that more degrees of freedom were involved in backward running. Speed
  however, did not affect coordination variability in either task.
