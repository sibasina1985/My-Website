abstract: 'Abstract: Agility is an essential part of many athletic activities. Currently,
  agility drill duration is the sole criterion used for evaluation of agility performance.
  The relationship between drill duration and factors such as acceleration, deceleration
  and change of direction, however, has not been fully explored. This paper provides
  a mathematical description of the relationship between velocity and radius of curvatures
  in an agility drill through implementation of a power law (PL). Two groups of skilled
  and unskilled participants performed a cyclic forward/backward shuttle agility test.
  Kinematic data was recorded using motion capture system at a sampling rate of 200Â Hz.
  The logarithmic relationship between tangential velocity and radius of curvature
  of participant trajectories in both groups was established using the PL. The slope
  of the regression line was found to be 0.26 and 0.36, for the skilled and unskilled
  groups, respectively. The magnitudes of regression line slope for both groups were
  approximately 0.3 which is close to the expected 1/3 value. Results are an indication
  of how the PL could be implemented in an agility drill thus opening the way for
  establishment of a more representative measure of agility performance instead of
  drill duration.'
