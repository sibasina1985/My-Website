abstract: © 2017 Elsevier Ltd This study aimed to determine the effect of added noise,
  filtering and time series length on the largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) value calculated
  for time series obtained from a passive dynamic walker. The simplest passive dynamic
  walker model comprising of two massless legs connected by a frictionless hinge joint
  at the hip was adopted to generate walking time series. The generated time series
  was used to construct a state space with the embedding dimension of 3 and time delay
  of 100 samples. The LyE was calculated as the exponential rate of divergence of
  neighboring trajectories of the state space using Rosenstein's algorithm. To determine
  the effect of noise on LyE values, seven levels of Gaussian white noise (SNR = 55–25
  dB with 5 dB steps) were added to the time series. In addition, the filtering was
  performed using a range of cutoff frequencies from 3 Hz to 19 Hz with 2 Hz steps.
  The LyE was calculated for both noise-free and noisy time series with different
  lengths of 6, 50, 100 and 150 strides. Results demonstrated a high percent error
  in the presence of noise for LyE. Therefore, these observations suggest that Rosenstein's
  algorithm might not perform well in the presence of added experimental noise. Furthermore,
  findings indicated that at least 50 walking strides are required to calculate LyE
  to account for the effect of noise. Finally, observations support that a conservative
  filtering of the time series with a high cutoff frequency might be more appropriate
  prior to calculating LyE.
