abstract: Characterizing the differences between the mechanical properties of brain
  tissue gray and white matters is of importance in biomechanics of brain tissue and
  may find a variety of different applications in medicine. In this study, a comparison
  has been made between mechanical behavior of bovine brain tissue white and gray
  matters. Through a linear elastic theory and using Bridgman method, necking phenomenon
  is considered for brain tissue in tension test. Results show that gray and white
  matters have different mechanical properties and differences between true and nominal
  values (the effect of cross section changes of the samples during the test) are
  not negligible. Besides, it is shown that for certain strains, linear elastic theory
  is acceptable for brain tissue modeling. These results are in agreement with the
  literature. Â© 2008 Science Publications.
