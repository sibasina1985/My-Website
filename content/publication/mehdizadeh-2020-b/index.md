abstract: "BACKGROUND: Gait impairments contribute to falls in people with dementia.\
  \ In this study, we used a vision-based system to record episodes of walking over\
  \ a 2-week period as participants moved naturally around their environment, and\
  \ from these calculated spatiotemporal, stability, symmetry, and acceleration gait\
  \ features. The aim of this study was to determine whether features of gait extracted\
  \ from a vision-based system are associated with falls, and which of these features\
  \ are most strongly associated with falling. METHODS: Fifty-two people with dementia\
  \ admitted to a specialized dementia unit participated in this study. Thirty different\
  \ features describing baseline gait were extracted from Kinect recordings of natural\
  \ gait over a 2-week period. Baseline clinical and demographic measures were collected,\
  \ and falls were tracked throughout the participants' admission. RESULTS: A total\
  \ of 1,744 gait episodes were recorded (mean 33.5 Â± 23.0 per participant) over a\
  \ 2-week baseline period. There were a total of 78 falls during the study period\
  \ (range 0-10). In single variable analyses, the estimated lateral margin of stability,\
  \ step width, and step time variability were significantly associated with the number\
  \ of falls during admission. In a multivariate model controlling for clinical and\
  \ demographic variables, the estimated lateral margin of stability (p = .01) was\
  \ remained associated with number of falls. CONCLUSIONS: Information about gait\
  \ can be extracted from vision-based recordings of natural walking. In particular,\
  \ the lateral margin of stability, a measure of lateral gait stability, is an important\
  \ marker of short-term falls risk."
