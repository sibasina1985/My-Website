abstract: Â© 2014 European College of Sport Science. The aim of this study was to investigate
  effects of speed and plane of motion on stability during locomotion in skilled football
  players. Ten male national-level football players participated in this study to
  run forward, backward and in lateral directions on a treadmill at 80%, 100% and
  120% of their preferred running speeds. The coordinate data of passive reflective
  markers attached to body segments were recorded using motion capture systems. Time
  series data obtained from the ankle marker were used for further analyses. The largest
  finite-time Lyapunov exponent and maximum Floquet multiplier were adopted to quantify
  local and orbital dynamic stabilities, respectively. Results showed that speed did
  not significantly change local and orbital dynamic stabilities in any of running
  patterns. However, both local and orbital dynamic stability were significantly higher
  in the secondary plane of progression. Data revealed that in running, unlike walking,
  stability in the direction perpendicular to the direction of running is significantly
  higher, implying that less active control is required in the secondary plane of
  progression. The results of this study could be useful in sports training and rehabilitation
  programmes where development of fundamental exercise programmes that challenge both
  speed and the ability to maintain stability might produce a tangible enhancement
  of athletic skill level.
