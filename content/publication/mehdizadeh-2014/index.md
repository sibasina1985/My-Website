abstract: '© 2014, © 2014 European College of Sport Science. Abstract: A number of
  studies have investigated effects of speed on local dynamic stability of walking,
  although this relationship has been rarely investigated under changing task constraints,
  such as during forward and backward running. To rectify this gap in the literature,
  the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of running speed on local dynamic
  stability of forward and backward running on a treadmill. Fifteen healthy male participants
  took part in this study. Participants ran in forward and backward directions at
  speeds of 80%, 100% and 120% of their preferred running speed. The three-dimensional
  motion of a C7 marker was recorded using a motion capture system. Local dynamic
  stability of the marker was quantified using short- and long-term largest finite-time
  Lyapunov exponents (LyE). Results showed that short-term largest finite-time LyE
  values increased with participant speed meaning that local dynamic stability decreased
  with increasing speed. Long-term largest finite-time LyEs, however, remained unaffected
  as speed increased. Results of this study indicated that, as in walking, slow running
  is more stable than fast running. These findings improve understanding of how stability
  is regulated when constraints on the speed of movements is altered. Implications
  for the design of rehabilitation or sport practice programmes suggest how task constraints
  could be manipulated to facilitate adaptations in locomotion stability during athletic
  training.'
