abstract: 'Research has indicated that human walking is more unstable in the secondary,
  rather than primary plane of progression. However, the mechanisms of controlling
  dynamic stability in different planes of progression during running remain unknown.
  The aim of this study was to compare variability (standard deviation and coefficient
  of variation) and dynamic stability (sample entropy and local divergence exponent)
  in anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions in forward and lateral running
  patterns. For this purpose, fifteen healthy, male participants ran in a forward
  and lateral direction on a treadmill at their preferred running speeds. Coordinate
  data of passive reflective markers attached to body segments were recorded using
  a motion capture system. Results indicated that: (1) there is lower dynamic stability
  in the primary plane of progression during both forward and lateral running suggesting
  that, unlike walking, greater control might be required to regulate dynamic stability
  in the primary plane of progression during running, (2) as in walking, the control
  of stability in anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions of running is dependent
  on the direction of progression, and (3), quantifying magnitude of variability might
  not be sufficient to understand control mechanisms in human movement and directly
  measuring dynamic stability could be an appropriate alternative.'
