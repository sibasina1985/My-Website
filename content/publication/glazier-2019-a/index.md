abstract: The development of methods that can identify athlete-specific optimum sports
  techniques—arguably the holy grail of sports biomechanics—is one of the greatest
  challenges for researchers in the field. This ‘perspectives article' critically
  examines, from a dynamical systems theoretical standpoint, the claim that athlete-specific
  optimum sports techniques can be identified through biomechanical optimisation modelling.
  To identify athlete-specific optimum sports techniques, dynamical systems theory
  suggests that a representative set of organismic constraints, along with their non-linear
  characteristics, needs to be identified and incorporated into the mathematical model
  of the athlete. However, whether the athlete will be able to adopt, and reliably
  reproduce, his/her predicted optimum technique will largely be dependent on his/her
  intrinsic dynamics. If the attractor valley corresponding to the existing technique
  is deep, or if the attractor valleys corresponding to the existing technique and
  the predicted optimum technique are in different topographical regions of the dynamic
  landscape, technical modifications may be challenging or impossible to reliably
  implement even after extended practice. The attractor layout defining the intrinsic
  dynamics of the athlete, therefore, needs to be determined to establish the likelihood
  of the predicted optimum technique being reliably attainable by the athlete. Given
  the limited set of organismic constraints typically used in mathematical models
  of athletes, combined with the methodological challenges associated with mapping
  the attractor layout of an athlete, it seems unlikely that athlete-specific optimum
  sports techniques will be identifiable through biomechanical optimisation modelling
  for the majority of sports skills in the near future.
