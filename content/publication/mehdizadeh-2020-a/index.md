abstract: "Objectives: To develop a prognostic model to predict the probability of\
  \ a short-term fall (within the next 7 to 30 days) in older adults with dementia.\
  \ Design: Prospective observational study. Setting and Participants: Fifty-one individuals\
  \ with dementia at high risk of falls from a specialized dementia inpatient unit.\
  \ Methods: Clinical and demographic measures were collected and a vision-based markerless\
  \ motion capture was used to record the natural gait of participants over a 2-week\
  \ baseline. Falls were tracked throughout the length of stay. Cox proportional hazard\
  \ regression analysis was used to build a prognostic model to determine fall-free\
  \ survival probabilities at 7 days and at 30 days. The model's discriminative ability\
  \ was also internally validated. Results: Fall history and gait stability (estimated\
  \ margin of stability) were statistically significant predictors of time to fall\
  \ and included in the final prognostic model. The model's predicted survival probabilities\
  \ were close to observed values at both 7 and 30 days. The area under the receiver\
  \ operating curve was 0.80 at 7 days, and 0.67 at 30 days and the model had a discrimination\
  \ performance (the Harrel concordance index) of 0.71. Conclusions and Implications:\
  \ Our short-term falls risk model had fair to good predictive and discrimination\
  \ ability. Gait stability and recent fall history predicted an imminent fall in\
  \ our population. This provides some preliminary evidence that the degree of gait\
  \ instability may be measureable in natural everyday gait to allow dynamic falls\
  \ risk monitoring. External validation of the model using a separate data set is\
  \ needed to evaluate model's predictive performance."
