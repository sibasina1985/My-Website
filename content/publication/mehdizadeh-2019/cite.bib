 abstract = {This study proposed a revision to the Rosenstein's method of numerical calculation of the largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) to make it more robust to noise. To this aim, the effect of increasing number of initial neighboring points on the LyE value was investigated and compared to values obtained by filtering the time series. Both simulated (Lorenz and passive dynamic walker) and experimental (human walking) time series were used to calculate the LyE. The number of initial neighbors used to calculate LyE for all time series was 1 (the original Rosenstein's method), 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 data points. The results demonstrated that the LyE graph reached a plateau at the 15-point neighboring condition implying that the LyE values calculated using at least 15 neighboring points were consistent. The proposed method could be used to calculate more consistent LyE values in experimental time series acquired from biological systems where noise is omnipresent.},
