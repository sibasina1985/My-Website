abstract: This paper evaluates the effectiveness of, and highlights issues with, conventional
  paradigms in applied sports biomechanics research and comments on their capacity
  to optimise techniques of individual athletes. In empirical studies, group-based
  analyses often mask variability between athletes and only permit probabilistic ‘in
  general' or ‘on average' statements that may not be applicable to specific athletes.
  In individual-based analyses, performance parameters typically exhibit a small range
  and a flat response over iterative performance trials, making establishing associations
  between performance parameters and the performance criterion problematic. In theoretical
  studies, computer simulation modelling putatively enables athlete-specific optimum
  techniques to be identified, but given each athlete's unique intrinsic dynamics,
  it is far from certain that these optimum techniques will be attainable, particularly
  under the often intense psychological pressures of competition, irrespective of
  the volume of practice undertaken. Sports biomechanists and coaching practitioners
  are advised to be more circumspect with regard to interpreting the results of applied
  sports biomechanics research and have greater awareness of their assumptions and
  limitations, as inappropriate interpretation of results may have adverse consequences
  for performance and injury.
